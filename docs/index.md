# Welcome to sandrigos notes!

A small online note-space, digital garden, call it what you want!
Here i curate my, mostly german, [[Obsidian]] notes using mkDocs, GitHub and GitHub-Pages!

## Hello World!

The `index.md` in the `/docs` folder is the homepage you see here.

The folders in `/docs` appear as the main sections on the navigation bar.

The notes appear as pages within these sections. For example, [[Note 1]] in `Topic 1`
